# About this project

I built an image classification model using fastai's machine learning library as a way to help my friend with a photo editing project he was working on.

Another friend built a simple Python desktop interface so that he could load images and label them for an eCommerce client. Then, I used already-labeled data to train an image-recognition model that could predict the label for the image. We integrated the prediction model into the desktop app, and saved my friend a LOT of time. 

Instead of manually labeling each image, he could simply confirm that the model had made the correct prediction, and only needed to manually label the images when the model was wrong (which was less than 2% of the time).
